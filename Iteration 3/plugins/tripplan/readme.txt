Turn your travel post into an interactive visual trip plan and map. Let users Print, Save, Share, Download to Mobile and more. 100% Free.

Letâ€™s be honest with ourselves. Most visitors will read your travel blog , pick up a few ideas and move on. So how do you make them stick with you?

People love plans & maps. So why not add them to your travel blog? With the Trip Plan plugin you can easily turn your blog posts into beautiful interactive trip plans. Simply mark the POIs (Points Of Interest) on your post and the plugin will automatically generate a trip plan and a matching interactive map. 

As your readers browse through the blog, they can easily mark which POIs they would like to save to their own Trip Plan. They can then Save the plan to their Free Checklist account or simply Print it. There is always a link back to your blog post so they will come back for more info (and not forget about you).

Notice how you get the sticky relationship as the list includes a link back to your blog which the user will see every time they use the list (even months after).

Once your readers save the list to their Checklist app (on iOS/ Android and Web), it will show as in screenshot 7 below.

Start by installing the plugin in your Plugins directory (or via the WordPress one click install)

#### Adding POIs
Open the blog post you wish to add the Trip Plan to and go to the first POI (Point Of Interest). This can be a place, an attraction, hotel, restaurant etc. Select the name of POI. Then: 

* Click on the Trip Plan button on your Editor and from the drop down select Add POI. Hit space on your keyboard to open the Google Places autocomplete and select the place from the drop down. You will see how the map centers on the position. You can drag the marker around if you want more accuracy.

* Optionally, add a link to the website of the place. This can be their official website, or a link to a page on your site dedicated to this place (if you have one).

* Optionally, add your recommended time in days or hours for spending at this place. 

* Optional: by default, the POI will be turned into a Heading 3 in your post. If you wish to change that to a different heading, or to have it inline (in the text), you can change the Presentation field.

* Hit Save to close the popup and the plugin will automatically generate a shortcode to display the POI in your post. If you like, you can try to experiment with changing the attributes of the shortcode (like name or props) but we recommend not to play with the placeId or the longitude/ latitude. If you wish to start from scratch, simple delete the shortcode.

Note: if you like to edit a POI, simply double click it and the popup will open.

#### Adding the Plan and Map
After you have gone through the post and marked all the POIs you wish to include in the trip plan, you can add the Plan and Map. Go to the position where you wish to have the trip plan and from the Trip Plan menu in your editor select Add Plan. In the popup set the name of the trip together with which heading to use (H1-H6) and hit Ok to save.

To add the map, place your cursor in the right position and select the Add Map from the Trip Plan menu in your editor. A shortcode will be generated and placed. You can change the height of the map if you wish. The width will always be 100% of the available space. 

Note: Plans and Maps must always be placed anywhere AFTER the last POI.

#### customization

From your left menu in the WordPress admin, choose the Trip Plan option. You will get to a page where you can customize the look and feel of the buttons, plans and maps (see screenshot 6 below) This is where you can also set the Google Maps API which is required in order to display the trip map. 

### Where can I use the plugin?

You can use the plugin on any post where you have a number of POIs which can be made into a trip plan. Remember that the idea is to visualize your story with a map and a trip plan. 

So get started with adding interactive trip plans to your travel blog!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the Google Maps API key

We use the Google's free Maps service to display maps and find POIs in your editor. Google is now restricting access to this service via what is called an API key. This can be freely obtained by following [our guide](https://checklist.com/how-to-generate-a-google-maps-api-key/).

= How does this affect SEO? 

It is your content and it stays on your site (for SEO). People love lists and search engines know that. More lists will result in more SEO juice. There is also a chance that Google will show your list as a snippet at the top of the search results. In addition, we automatically generate schema.org tags which enhance your post in the eyes of search engines.

= I have changed the colors on the admin but they do not reflect in the front end

You probably paste the color code without the # . Please ensure you have codes like #FF5722 and NOT FF5722.

= After clicking Save or Print I get an empty page

The actual saving or printing of a checklist will only work on published posts. In addition, sometimes your web server may block our server from fetching the HTML of the checklist on your site so that we can process it and save it to the user's account or print it. Look at your firewall log and unblock the calls made from our servers.
